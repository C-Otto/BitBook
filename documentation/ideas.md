## Forks
It may be helpful to be able to answer questions like "How many Bitcoin Cash do I have, and where?"
for forks like Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, ... that share parts of their blockchain with Bitcoin.
This can be done by making use of the block height information (before/after a fork?), and making the
code fork-aware.
